# String Searching Program

This program searches for a user-specified string in a file or input and prints out the lines or words that contain the string or are similar to the string.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the program using your preferred C compiler.
3. Run the program using the following command: `./program < input_file`.

## Usage

The program has two modes of operation, which can be selected by entering either 'a' or 'b' at runtime:

### Mode A

In mode A, the program searches for the user-specified string in a file or input and prints out the lines that contain the string.

To enter mode A, enter 'a' when prompted.

### Mode B

In mode B, the program searches for the user-specified string in a file or input and prints out the words that are similar to the string (i.e., differ by at most one character).

To enter mode B, enter 'b' when prompted.
